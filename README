### User Retention ### 

This program is a prototype focused on computing user retention for offline internal analytics. A more productionized version of this could be an internal tool used 
within companies. 

It accepts one command line argument as the name of the CSV file. This CSV file which contains two columns: Unix epoch timestamps, and a userId could be imagined as logs from a user activity database. I chose the first to the 15th days of the month but the program can be 
further parametrized to accept any date range, or work without date ranges at all.

Program outputs an NxN grid which shows the subsequent user journey of a user who started on a given day. It answers the question as to which days led to the most user retention.

Only python3 runtime and std libraries have been used in this solution. 

It can be run with: python3 retention.py [path to csv file]
